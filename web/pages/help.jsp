          <h2><A NAME="introduction">Introduction</A></h2>
          <b>NCI Thesaurus (NCIt)</b> is an extensive reference terminology
          with some complex features.  Each specific meaning, such as melanoma,
          lung, or chemotherapy, is represented by a distinct <i>concept</i>
          with a unique, permanent <i>code</i>.  Each concept provides 
          additional information such as a preferred name, other terms
          and codes, definitions, and relationships with other concepts.  
          Concepts are organized within major categories,
          such as anatomy and gene, and arranged in logical parent-child
          hierarchies from very broad top concepts down to the most
          specific subcategories.
        </p>
        <p class="textbody">
          <b>The NCIt Browser</b> is designed for ease of use by a diverse
          user community.  This first release focuses on the data and
          features most users want.  Future releases will add advanced
          search options, user-defined reports, and other things users
          ask for.  For information on other NCIt browsers, file formats,
          and computer application access, see the

          <b>This help file</b> provides basic information about how to use the NCIt Browser effectively. It also provides pointers on how to learn more about NCIt and related resources. The following typeface font conventions are used for describing search and the browser interface:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Sans Serif Bold</b>: Browser links and buttons
            <li><font face="courier">Fixed Width</font>: Search strings
            <li><i>Italics</i>: Concept terms
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="textbody">
          <h2><A NAME="searchhelp">Search</A></h2>
          <b>In the Search box</b>, enter all or part of what you are looking for and click the <b>Search</b> button. Some details:
          <ul>
            <li>You can search for a concept’s preferred name, synonyms, acronyms, or codes.
            <li><b>Exact Match</b> is the default: Only terms or codes that are identical will match.
            <li><b>Begins With</b> can be selected to find all terms or codes that start with the words or characters you enter.
            <li><b>Contains</b> will search for what you enter anywhere within a term or code (e.g., <font face="courier">carcinoma</font> will match <i>adenocarcinoma</i>).
            <li>Concept Codes will only match if they exactly match what you enter, even if you select <b>Begins With</b> or <b>Contains</b>.
            <li>Search is not case sensitive (e.g., <font face="courier">aids</font> will match <i>aids</i>, <i>Aids</i>, and <i>AIDS</i>).
            <li>There are no wildcard characters.  All characters are matched literally (e.g., searching for <b>Begins With</b> <font face="courier">NAT2*</font> will match <i>NAT2*5 Allele</i> but not <i>NAT2 Gene</i>).
            <li>Do not use quotes – they will be searched for literally, as characters in concept terms.
            <li>Searching for multiple words does not search on each word separately.  To match, all words have to be found in the same order you provided.  For example, if you do a <b>Contains</b> search on <font face="courier">Melanoma Corneal</font> no results will be returned, but if you search on <font face="courier">Corneal Melanoma</font> you get the detail page for <i>Corneal Melanoma</i>.</li>
            
          </ul>
          Search of other concept data, approximate matching, and other features will be added to future releases of this
          browser. Some of these features are currently available in the <a href="http://bioportal.nci.nih.gov/ncbo/faces/index.xhtml">NCI BioPortal Browser</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p class="textbody">
            <b>Search results</b> are displayed by concept preferred name. (If there is only one match, the concept details page is shown directly without first listing results.) Some details:           
            <ul>
              <li>All matching concepts are returned.</li> 
              <li>Results are listed from best match to weakest. For example, a <b>Contains</b> search on <font face="courier">Bone</font> returns <i>Bone</i> at the top, followed by concepts with two word matches (e.g., <i>Flat Bone</i>), followed by concepts whose terms have more non-<i>Bone</i> content.</li>
              <li>The match will often be to synonyms or codes only visible on the concept details page (e.g., searching <b>Begins With</b> <font face="courier">melanoma</font> will show <i>Corneal Melanoma</i> in the results list because that concept contains a synonym of <i>Melanoma of the Cornea</i>.) A future release will show these matches in the results window.</li>
              <li>If there are too many to show on one page, you can page through the results with a default of 50 per page. To change the default number, use the <b>Show results per page</b> drop-down menu at the bottom of the results page.</li>
              <li>In the next release, concepts whose status is unusual (e.g., retired or obsolete) will show their status in parentheses in the results listing.</li>
              <li>Click on the preferred name to see a concept’s details.</li>
            </ul>

          <h2><A NAME="conceptdetails">Concept Details</A></h2>
          
          Detailed information on the selected concept is grouped and shown on several related pages:
          <ul>
            <li>Tabbed information gives the concept’s meaning, labels, and direct relationships:</li>
            <ul> 
              <li><b>Terms & Properties:</b> Gives definitions, synonyms, abbreviations, codes, and other information.</li>
              <li><b>Relationships:</b> Shows how other concepts are directly related to this concept as  parents, children, or in other ways.</li>
              <li><b>Synonym Details:</b> For each term or abbreviation, shows its term type, source, and code (for outside sources that have them).</li>
              <li><b>View All:</b> Combines all of the above information on a single page.</li>
            </ul> 
            <li><b>View in Hierarchy:</b> Click the button to see where the concept is found within the NCI Thesaurus hierarchy. Concepts are often found in several different places. The focused concept will be bold, underlined, and colored red.</li>

          <h2><A NAME="knownissues">Known Issues</A></h2>
          Most known issues are limits to functionality and documentation that we are working to address for release 2.  These include the following: 
          <ul>
            <li>Some searches returning thousands of results hit internal limits in the LexEVS 4.2/LexBIG 2.3 server.  The browser detects this failure and falls back to a safe search that will return only some of the matching concepts (only full-word matches, normally the best), warning the user about the problem.  This problem should be fixed with the LexEVS 5.0 release in June 2009.</li>
            <li>The default scoring for search matches will continue to be improved, and some user-settable options should be part of the forthcoming <b>Advanced Search</b> page.</li>
            <li>Online and standalone documentation are still under development.</li>
          </ul>
          Please report any bugs or suggestions using the browser’s <a href="<%= contactUsUrl %>">Contact Us</a> page.
