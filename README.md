Welcome to the NCI Term Browser Project!

The NCI Term Browser is a web-based browser that allows users to search all terminologies, value sets and mappings 
on the LexEVS terminology server, to browse individual sources, and to easily follow the many links that connect them.

NCI Term Browser is developed in Java and requires Apache Ant for building.
